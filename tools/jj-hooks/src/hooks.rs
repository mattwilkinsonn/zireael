//! Per-bookmark hook execution pipeline.

//! For each bookmark update being pushed:
//! 1. Resolve one or more `from_ref` commits (the ancestors on the remote).
//! 2. Create an ephemeral detached worktree at the new commit.
//! 3. Run the configured hook backend against each `from_ref` in turn.
//!    Modifications accumulate in the same worktree.
//! 4. If the worktree ended up with modifications, build a fixup commit
//!    via `git commit-tree`, anchor it under `refs/jj-hooks/fixup/<bookmark>`,
