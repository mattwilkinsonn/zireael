//! Per-bookmark hook execution pipeline.
//!
//! For each bookmark update being pushed:
//! 1. Resolve one or more `from_ref` commits (the ancestors on the remote).
//! 2. Create an ephemeral detached worktree at the new commit.
//! 3. Run the configured hook backend against each `from_ref` in turn.
//!    Modifications accumulate in the same worktree.
//! 4. If the worktree ended up with modifications, build a fixup commit
//!    via `git commit-tree`, anchor it under `refs/jj-hooks/fixup/<bookmark>`,
//!    and `jj git import` so jj sees it.
//! 5. Optionally re-run the hook backend against the fixup commit; if
//!    the re-run is clean, the overall outcome is reported as success
//!    with `initial_failure = true` so callers can surface the
//!    transient failure. See [`RunOpts::retry_after_fixup`].
//! 6. Optionally advance the bookmark to the fixup commit.
